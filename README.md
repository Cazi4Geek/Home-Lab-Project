1. **Four Servers**:
    - One server (Windows Server 2022) will act as the **Domain Controller (DC01)**, responsible for managing the Active Directory (AD) and handling authentication and authorization within the domain.
    - The second server (Windows Server 2022) will be used for other purposes such as file storage, applications, or additional services required within the network(FS01).
    - The third server (Windows Server 2022) will be used for other purposes such as database system, with a few test records(DB01).
    - Additionally, a Linux server will be implemented to run Docker with simple web page.
2. **Four Client Machines**:
    - These machines will be used to simulate end-user workstations within the network. Each machine will be joined to the domain controlled by the Domain Controller.
  
    - Naming Convention
        - Prefix: Client
        - Unique Number: 001, 002, 003, 004

        Detailed Naming List:
        1. Client-001
        2. Client-002
        3. Client-003
        4. Client-004
### Organizational Units (OUs) for Departments

To keep our domain structure well-organized, we will create Organizational Units (OUs) for each department. This will help us manage users, computers, and other resources efficiently within Active Directory. The following OUs will be created:

### Summary of Steps

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Set up Hyper-V on your host machine** |   |
|     1.1 | **Install Hyper-V**: Open the Control Panel, navigate to Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off, check the box for Hyper-V, click OK, and restart your computer. <br/><br/> <img width="1052" height="936" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32e20fd-df5a-4964-8359-30d90abc5b51" /> |
|     1.2 | **Configure Hyper-V**: Open Hyper-V Manager from the Start menu, select your host machine, and configure virtual switches by going to Virtual Switch Manager in the right-hand Actions menu. Create a new External virtual switch to allow VMs to access your physical network. <br/><br/> <img width="1442" height="1368" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd3eb97-f6d9-459e-829b-17b11d53e5b9" />|
| **2. Create Virtual Machines** |   |
|     2.1 | **Create the Domain Controller VM**: In Hyper-V Manager, click New > Virtual Machine, and follow the wizard to set up the VM with appropriate settings such as name, generation, memory, network, and virtual hard disk. Install an operating system later. <br/> In my case, I'm going to choose to change the default path to store the virtual machine, as it seems more organized to me. In this case, I'll opt to place it in C:\Hyper-V\VMs\\. <br/><br/> <img width="1404" height="1060" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ebc2568-b066-4932-a576-3e07fd577fe2" /> <br/><br/> Afterwards, I select Generation 1, as Generation 2 can be prone to errors. <br/><br/> <img width="1406" height="1060" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15f9f4c2-0509-4c77-a858-4a35cc129302" /> <br/><br/> Now, I need to allocate the RAM to the virtual machine. In this case, I'll opt for the minimum recommended for Windows Server 2022 with Desktop Experience, which is 4GB (4096 MB). <br/> Additionally, I'll choose to leave the **'Use dynamic memory for this virtual machine'** checkbox checked. <br> When a virtual machine uses dynamic memory, it means that its memory allocation can adjust automatically based on the demand from the operating system and applications running within the virtual machine. Instead of assigning a fixed amount of memory, the virtual machine can request and release memory as needed, allowing for more efficient utilization of host resources. <br/><br/> <img width="1406" height="1066" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722357ba-379b-4679-8389-2d072e3d73b8" /> <br/><br/> Then, I select the network adapter to which the virtual machine will connect. In this case, it's the network adapter created in step 1.2 (WAN), which is associated with my Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 wireless network card. <br/><br/> <img width="1404" height="1058" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59c9524a-0f89-4926-95a3-1c7cbcdec257" /> <br/><br/> Next, I will create a virtual hard disk of 2TB (2048GB), which will be more than enough for any practice you may want to perform. <br/><br/> <img width="1406" height="1058" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58013fe8-8e5a-49a1-afb2-dc662f440bd0" /> <br/><br/> Finally, I select the option 'Install an operating system from a bootable CD/DVD-ROM' and locate the location of the .ISO file containing the Windows Server 2022 Operating System. <br/><br/> <img width="1400" height="1062" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3f8c16-c6e4-4216-9a0f-8c78347a10f3" /> <br/><br/> Once this is done, the virtual machine is successfully created. Now, all that's left is to connect to it, start it up, and follow the Windows Server installer. <br/><br/> <img width="2064" height="464" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f482c3-10a6-481e-898b-9d1028b8909a" /> |
|     2.2 | **Create the fourth Server VM**: Follow the same steps as above but name this VM Server2. <br/><br/> Next, I create the second virtual machine, which will also have Windows Server 2022 as its operating system. I will avoid detailing the installation as it is the same as the DC01 virtual machine, only the name is different. <br/> In this case, the virtual machine will be named 'FS01'. <br/><br/> <img width="1402" height="1062" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce534b9-ecf0-4141-a5ab-ed5f90c20be9" /> <br/><br/> Then, once all the fields are filled out, I have the 2 server machines created. <br/><br/> <img width="2064" height="464" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3325d8b8-c4e2-40e0-b5ef-2b209ad2fc33" /> |
|     2.3 | **Create the Client VMs**: Repeat the VM creation process four times for client machines, naming them Client-001, Client-002, Client-003, and Client-004. Assign at least 1024 MB of memory to each client VM. <br/><br/> Now, I repeat the process but instead of using the Windows Server 2022 .iso file as the boot disk, I choose the Windows 10 .iso file. <br/><br/> <img width="1402" height="1062" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/123e067f-e33d-45e8-89c1-bdcda02ddd36" /> <br/><br/> <img width="1396" height="1064" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c8c47bb-b615-4e12-8340-72270893da35" /> <br/><br/> Then, once the 4 servers (Windows Server 2022) and the four client machines (Windows 10) are created, I have the following: <br/><br/> |
| **3. Install the necessary operating systems on all VMs** |   |
|     3.1 | **Prepare installation media**: Obtain ISO files for Windows Server (for the servers) and Windows 10/11 (for the client machines). <br/><br/> In this case, I chose to download both .iso files (Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10) beforehand, but you can also choose the option 'Install an operating system later,' which creates the virtual machine and waits for you to attach the desired .iso file later. <br/><br/> If you prefer to do it that way, you can download the .iso files from the official Microsoft website: <br/><br/> -  [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/es-ES/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022)<br/> -  [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/software-download/windows10) <br/> |
|     3.2 | **Install Windows Server on DC1 and Server2**: Start the VM, connect to it, attach the Windows Server ISO, and follow the installation prompts to install Windows Server. Configure the server with appropriate settings (e.g., server name, IP address). <br/><br/> Once the virtual machine is created and the Windows Server 2022 disk is 'inserted,' I will start it and proceed with the installation. I will perform this process for all the four servers the DC01 (Domain Controller) server , the FS01 server, DB01 server, and WEB01 server. <br/><br/> <img width="1334" height="1076" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0109efb-1f82-4aa3-ab95-8fbedbd7935e" /> <br/><br/> After clicking 'Install,' I need to select the version I want. Among the options are the Standard and Datacenter versions, each with a Desktop Experience (GUI) version and a Server Core version. In this case, I will select the Standard version with Desktop Experience: <br/><br/> <img width="671" height="508" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01901ba4-4166-44c5-a398-09db3c17f273" /> <br/><br/> Next, I need to select the partition on which the operating system will be installed. In this case, it is the only partition I have: the 2TB partition created when I created the virtual machine, but I could also create another partition and install it there. <br/><br/> <img width="667" height="509" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0353b056-5449-4a2c-a398-f9821f2d27f6" /> <br/><br/> After selecting the partition, the installer will continue copying files and installing the operating system. The installation time varies depending on the resources, both those we have and those allocated to the virtual machine. <br/><br/> <img width="671" height="507" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4fd7f54-9812-420c-83b3-18c9297699c9" /> <br/><br/> Now, once the above is completed, you will be prompted to create a password for the 'Administrator' user, who has full control over the operating system. This account is similar to the superuser in Linux. It is essential to remember this password. <br/><br/> <img width="1338" height="1002" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7a84499-108c-467b-b6f8-f55b6f4d4aa3" /> <br/><br/> Now, I can log in with the credentials provided recently. <br/><br/> <img width="849" height="647" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8014092-3922-43b2-ae3e-95254d81e994" /> <br/><br/> Once logged in, the 'Server Manager' will automatically open (this can be disabled), which allows managing Roles and Features, configuring the server's Firewall, changing the name, changing the IP address, managing storage, etc. <br/><br/> In this case, within the 'Local Server' section, I will change its name and IP address. The IP address will change from being managed by DHCP to static, which is seen as a good practice (in servers, not in client machines), as it increases reliability among other reasons. <br/><br/> <img width="2560" height="1600" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af774325-b91d-47e0-b35e-adc0c21cd355" /> <br/> <br/> The **name** will be: DC01. <br/><br/> <img width="644" height="752" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b706db-1e4e-42cf-8d6a-9860f0e9b55c" /> <br/><br/> The **static IP address** for DC01 will be: 10.10.0.10 <br/> The **subnet mask** will be: 255.255.255.0, which means that the first 3 octets of the IP address (10.10.0) will correspond to identifying the network portion, while the fourth and last octet will correspond to identifying the host portion. In this case, with the /24 subnet mask, we get 2^8 - 2 (254) available hosts for the devices and/or servers (2 raised to the available bits, minus 2 because there are 2 addresses that cannot be assigned: 10.10.0.0, which corresponds to the network address, and 10.10.0.255, which corresponds to the broadcast address). <br/> The **default gateway** will be 10.10.0.1, corresponding to the IP address of the default gateway that I have. <br/> The **primary DNS server** will be: 8.8.8.8, corresponding to Google's public DNS server. <br/> **The alternate DNS server** will be: 8.8.4.4, also corresponding to another public DNS server provided by Google. <br/><br/> <img width="397" height="460" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c7e0dbf-08bb-43ec-91d8-07643bc06a7f" /> <br/><br/> To apply the changes (the server name change), it is necessary to restart the computer. <br/><br/> That's all for the DC01 server (temporarily, although it's still not a domain controller). Now, I will proceed to install the Windows Server operating system on the other server machine (FS01).  |
|     3.3 | **Install Windows 10/11 on client VMs**: Start each client VM, connect to it, attach the Windows 10/11 ISO, and follow the installation prompts to install Windows. Configure each client with appropriate settings (e.g., machine name, IP address). <br/><br/> Once the Windows 10 disk is 'inserted' into the client machine, I proceed to start it to initiate the installation process. <br/><br/> <img width="1534" height="1288" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7168ac55-4695-401b-a34f-0166c7932b32" /> <br/><br/> Then, I press "Install now," and enter the product key (if available). In this case, I don't have one, so I select "I don't have a product key. <br/><br/> <img width="1536" height="1292" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab06df6c-c493-4c21-846c-3a110d7f3eb2" /> <br/><br/> Now, I select the version of Windows that I want to install. It's crucial to choose the Pro or Education version, as the Home version lacks the capability to join an Active Directory domain, thus cannot be centrally managed. In this case, I will opt for the Windows 10 Pro version. <br/><br/> <img width="1542" height="1284" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea2a0d1-fe05-49fc-bc99-4c2e4f01d1ec" /> <br/><br/> Now, I select again the partition on which I want to install the operating system. In this case, it's the only partition I have created. <br/><br/> <img width="1536" height="1288" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d94440-ea9c-437a-bd51-421bdf274961" /> <br/><br/> Now, I must wait for the installation process to finish. <br/><br/> ![Win-05](images/win-05.PNG) <br/><br/> That's it. Now, once the operating system has started, I complete the final configurations (region, keyboard, network, local account, privacy, etc.), and once the desktop is displayed, I proceed to change the computer name to "JMFSOFT-PC01": <br/><br/> ![Win-06](images/win-06.PNG) <br/><br/> Finally, I repeat the process for the rest of the computers, only varying the name (JMFSOFT-PC02, JMFSOFT-PC03, and JMFSOFT-PC04). |
